## Edge IoT and Robotics Course

This repository contains projects and experiments from my **Edge IoT and Robotics** course, where I explored **Arduino, ESP32, sensors, actuators, and edge computing**. Under the mentorship of **Redwan Ferdous Sir**, I gained hands-on experience in **IoT-based automation, sensor integration, and robotics applications**.

### Key Learnings & Experiments
- Interfacing **sensors** (PIR, IR, ultrasonic, temperature, etc.)  
- **Actuator control** (motors, relays, solenoids)  
- **ESP32 and Arduino** programming  
- **Wireless communication** (Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, MQTT)  
- **Edge computing & real-time data processing**  
- **Automation systems** (home, lab, and industrial use cases)  

This repository showcases my practical implementations and learnings from the course.
